## Learn is Fun! 

[üñ•Ô∏è Site live]( https://ivettemcdermott.github.io/PP2-Js/)

This site is designed to provide a tool where the children can practice in a fun way describing clothing items with a basic sentence structure, according to a randomly displayed picture. The image is not just focus on articles of clothing but also on a basic range of colors. 
The exercises are targeted to be used by children at elementary level of English.

The site opens with a full welcome screen with a fun animated character inviting the child to start the game, once the start button is clicked the welcome screen hides, and allows the child to see the game screen with a div in front where there the instructions for play can be read. The div needs to be closed in order to start the game itself.

The first step to click on the "Get a picture" button, which internally generates a random number that will allow the functions to start the process and search in the array which object will be used. This object contains the picture, answer options and the correct answer for this exercise. On the screen, the picture and the options for the inputs radio will be displayed.

Next, the child will select one of the options, and after clicking the "Check your answer" button, this action will trigger a function that compares the selected with the correct option. On the screen, a gif with an audio according to the result being right or wrong will be displayed.
The gifs and audios used are cartoonish in order to not discourage the child and to make the process fun.

The score, as the exercise actions are repeated over and over, it will log the amount of tries, and the amount of right answers. As the amount of tries get to ten, the game will stop and give back a final result in a pop div where can be read the number of right answers of the ten tries that had been done, that together with an encouraging message and a fun gif again.

After that, the children will need to exit the game as it will be locked. The game won't exit automatically, this thinking of the children could want to show their results to someone that it is not inmediatelly available.

The exit is triggered by a button in the bottom right corner, it will give an alert to confirm the exit and a second one inviting them to come back again. After that it will bring the screen to the welcome one again.

Additional features, in the top right corner can be found two buttons, one with the question mark symbol, easily recognizable as help, which will display the instructions div again when clicked.  Next to it, the audio button, it will play and pause a background audio that had been set to a reduced volume in order not to be intrusive while the game is being played.
