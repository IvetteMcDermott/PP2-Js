## Learning is Fun! 

[üñ•Ô∏è Site live]( https://ivettemcdermott.github.io/PP2-Js/)

This site is designed to provide a tool where children can practice in a fun way describing clothing items with a basic sentence structure, according to a randomly displayed picture. The image is not just focused on articles of clothing but also on a basic range of colors. 
The exercises are targeted to be used by children at elementary level English.

The site opens with a full welcome screen with a fun animated character inviting the child to start the game, once the start button is clicked the welcome screen hides, and allows the child to see the game screen with a div in front where there the instructions for play can be read. The div needs to be closed in order to start the game itself.

The first step to click on the "Get a picture" button, which internally generates a random number that will allow the functions to start the process and search in the array which object will be used. This object contains the picture, answer options and the correct answer for this exercise. On the screen, the picture and the options for the inputs radio will be displayed.

Next, the child will select one of the options, and after clicking the "Check your answer" button, this action will trigger a function that compares the selected with the correct option. On the screen, a gif with an audio according to the result being right or wrong will be displayed.
The gifs and audios used are cartoonish in order to not discourage the child and to make the process fun.

The score, as the exercise actions are repeated over and over, it will log the amount of tries, and the amount of right answers. As the amount of tries get to ten, the game will stop and give back a final result in a pop div where can be read the number of right answers of the ten tries that had been done, that together with an encouraging message and a fun gif again.

After that, the children will need to exit the game as it will be locked. The game won't exit automatically, this thinking that the children could want to show their results to someone that it is not immediately available.

The exit is triggered by a button in the bottom right corner, it will give an alert to confirm the exit and a second one inviting them to come back again. After that it will bring the screen to the welcome one again.

Additional features, in the top right corner can be found two buttons, one with the question mark symbol, easily recognizable as help, which will display the instructions div again when clicked.  Next to it, the audio button, it will play and pause a background audio that had been set to a reduced volume in order not to be intrusive while the game is being played.

### Features that can be implemented in the future

- The array can be increased with new objects and with this the vocabulary to use. 
- New levels can be added to increase the difficulty of grammar.
- New subjects can be added to widen the range of vocabulary.
- A form that sends the results to a data base, or the teacher or tutor of the children by email.
- A report could be included that show a full list of the selected answers, indicating if they were right or wrong.
- A timer between last feedback and final result div being display.
- Automatic display of next picture. It hadn't being implemented because this would take away the possibility that the user have a review in what had done.

- Being the target user young children, and following the methodology of visual materials size for them, it shouldn't be used in small screens, in that case a screen message could be displayed asking them to visit us from a bigger device. As the example follows:

## Design

The game had been created from zero, but had been influeced by exercise pages for children like British Council where different types of practice exercises can be found.

Color scheme had been based in a selection from https://coolors.co/.

Typography, the font used for the website is "PT Sans" from Google Fonts. Easy to read in any element.

### Lighthouse

- For mobiles. Lower performance against the monitors, mainly because it suggests the use of videos instead GIF but this would modify the transparency of the element, and this will affect the visual display.

### Bugs

Due to the current function that generates the random number is possible to get the same image more than once. This had been left without fix at the moment. While been tested, it hadn't been often but it's a possibility so I am researching in order to give a solution to it.
